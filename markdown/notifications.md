## Data sent to the webhook endpoint (non-Slack)

--- row ---

Notifications are app events sent to a custom HTTP endpoint.
You can refer to our ['Events' documentation](http://developers.scalingo.com/events.html) to know the notification JSON format.

At the moment only `deployment` events are sent.

Example of a deployment notification:

```json
